As I have previously worked on building a restaurant ordering system with Python, I wanted to use the concepts with ASP.NET. Having a deep understanding on how to build similar apps with different frameworks really boosts my understanding on how different programming languages work.

The concept of Inheritance has been used among my tables to link Restaurants with their Items as well as orders have been linked with items in that restaurant.

Time and Date are displayed along with a string which emphasises on the concept of Polymorphism.

A lot of code have been written down to build the functionality which the user doesn't have to see. Abstraction has been used in parts like the NavBar which provides links for the entire project but the user can't tell whats going behind the scene with my code.

Encapsulation has been used where I don't have to manually update time and date, I've used to the library provided to show dynamic date and time on the footer.
